        This course meets daily for 90 minutes and students receive graduation credits required for Health and Physical Education. Benson has combined its traditional Health and PE classes to be able to offer DAILY fitness development and an experiential approach to health concepts. This F2LL program is committed to year-long practice of optimal exercise, healthy eating and mental strength habits for our students. This new approach is our response to the national problems around academic achievement and obesity.
            <br>
            <br>
        The F2LL program was co-created and piloted in 2013 by Benson staff, Linda McLellan and Katie Meyer in partnership with HealthCorps Coordinator, Amy Dushane. The current model is based upon PPS Common Curriculum Goals and Standards, HealthCorps' curriculum, and proven research from HealthCorps Advisory Board Member Dr. John Ratey's book: "SPARK: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain". In 2013, Loudspeaker Films produced a documentary called <i>The Heart of the Matter</i>. The documentary highlights the success of our first year piloting F2LL. It's been featured at The Portland Film Festival; throughout PPS; at Scholastic; The Oregon School Employee Wellness Conference and at HealthCorps trainings and annual Gala.

                The goal of this program is to focus primarily on three aspects of health & wellness. <b><i>Fitness & Exercise; Mental Strength and Nutrition</i></b>. Health and Physical Education infuses both curriculums into many creative and collaborative lessons that enhance understanding through experiential learning. However, each course is graded separately. Our motto: Learn it, feel it, know it, show it. <u>Learn it</u> through lecture & discussion; <u>Feel it</u> with labs & experience; <u>Know it</u> through studying/homework; and <u>Show it</u> with demonstration, assessments, and group projects.

This beginner level offers more time spent on instruction so that each student successfully passes the assessments or demonstrates daily expectations. Advanced level of participation includes giving prepared and proficient students more choices; challenges and opportunities to be self-directed. Both levels are assessed with the same grading rubrics. The main purpose of the two levels are to insure that all students learn by re-teaching those who need it as well as challenging, promoting and rewarding proficient students who demonstrate good academic habits.

                The F2LL logo represents a <b><i>relatable figure</i></b> - a Techman/Techster. Specifically a Techman/Techster running Benson's own Old Gym elevated running track.
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b><i>The window</i></b>  pictures a unique connection to the building itself, as the window itself is one of the windows that runs the length of the Old Gym building. </li>
                      <br>
                        
                  <i>
*Notice the unique top fan pattern that sets the Old Gym's windows apart from any other.
                    </i>  
                    <br>
                    <br><li>
                    <b><i>The flare of sunlight</i></b>   through the window represents power, possibility, and potential. All of which are being harnessed by the Techman/Techster.  </li>
                    <br>
                   
                    The logo image is often recreated when the Fit2Live&Learn class is in session, the sun is in the right line with the South bank of gym windows, and perhaps most importantly, the Techman/Techster, the focus of the image, are pushing themself to succeed.
